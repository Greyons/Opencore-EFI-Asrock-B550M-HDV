# Opencore-EFI-Asrock-B550M-HDV

For now I will keep a short description. This is my EFI made for asrock b550m-hdv with ryzen 5 5600x, rx 6650 xt and 16GB DDR4 3200mhz, It works from Big Sur to Sequoia. Test it if you want it since it's free. I have no issues so far and if i find anything I will update this post! As of now this opencore version is 1.0.1 and all kexts are up to date. If NootRX doesn't let you boot into recovery mode just replace it with whatevergreen and add agdpmod=pikera and it should work! After that switch back to NooRX and delete agdpmod=pikera. Good luck!
